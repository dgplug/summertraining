Tor Project
============

    What is Tor?
        Tor is free software and an open network that helps you defend against traffic
        analysis, a form of network surveillance that threatens personal freedom and
        privacy, confidential business activities and relationships, and state
        security.

The `Tor Project <https://www.torproject.org>`_ is the most suggested project
when it comes to protect privacy and anonymity. We suggest dgplug participants
to download the Tor Browser, and start using it for regular Internet access
from the beginning.


Why should you use Tor?

time the connection will take some time, afterwards it will be much faster.
