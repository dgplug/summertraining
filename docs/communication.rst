Communication
=============

We use IRC as our primary communication during summer training and it also a
main communication medium for many FOSS projects.

How to use IRC?
----------------

Read `how to register your nickname <https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/How_to_use_IRC>`_.

Register your nickname
-----------------------

Remember to register your nickname, you can follow `this guide <http://www.wikihow.com/Register-a-User-Name-on-Freenode>`_.

Rules to follow
---------------

Be nice to others. 

Always type full English words, no sms speak in any FOSS communications. That
means no more 'u' or 'r', instead type 'you' or 'are'.

Though are few short forms which are acceptable in IRC.
