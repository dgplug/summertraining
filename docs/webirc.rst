IRC on the Web
==============
While a client (xchat, hexchat, etc), on any platform, is the best way to experience IRC on a daily basis, you can in fact use your web browser to connect to IRC!

While it might not be as comfortable as a native client, irc via a browser is actually quite full featured.

It depends on you knowing commands though, so `this page on the IRC beginner website <http://ircbeginner.com/ircinfo/ircc-commands.html>`_ will come in real handy.

So let’s start at the very beginning.

Here’s what we’d need for our summer sessions.

1. We need a browser
2. We need an username that stays the same, throughout sessions
3. We need to login to the #dgplug channel on `freenode <https://webchat.freenode.net>`_ with that username

Step 1. The Browser
-------------------
Congratulations!

You’ve already have one and are successfully connected, if you’re reading this :)

Step 2. A username for IRC.
---------------------------

Let’s mosey over to the `freenode website <https://webchat.freenode.net>`_

| Login with the username you want, like I’ve done here.
| I’ve chosen ``mariojason`` for a username.
| Ignore the channel and auth options for now.  
| Just clear the I am not a robot test.

And you should enter the world of irc!

There’ll be a lot of stuff that’ll end with a screen like this.

| You’ll obviously have figured out that the little white box at the bottom is where you type in your messages and commands. 
| You can type ``/quit`` to quit your connection for example.
| Also note the tab that says “status” (not visible in the pic) above at the top of your window. 
| You’ll want to click this tab before typing in sensitive IRC commands (as you will do shortly).
| You’ll see more tabs at the top as you join channels later and you’ll use the tabs to switch between them.

| You in with your username? Good.
| Now let’s register it so that we can always have the same one.
| Type the command ``/msg NickServ REGISTER <password> <email>``, where password will be some complicated password of yours while email is where you put in your email address
| You can see me doing it below

If all works well, Nickserv will reply saying that activation instructions have been sent to your email id, like so …

So hop over and check your mail. This is what you should expect to see.

Let’s copy the ``/msg`` line and go back to the irc page and paste it in the chat bar like so …

And voila! You should be verified!

Now that we’re done registering our nickname, quit the connection by typing in the ``/quit`` command and let’s move to …

Step 3. Connecting to the DGPLUG channel.
-----------------------------------------

Now we’re back to `where we started <https://webchat.freenode.net>`_.

Only this time, fill in all the details.

1. Put in your nickname
2. Use #dgplug as the channel to connect
3. Enable auth to services
4. The username is the same as the nickname
5. Fill in the complicated password that you had created for your id.

And hit Connect!

You should login and you should be switched to a new tab with the #dgplug channel.
