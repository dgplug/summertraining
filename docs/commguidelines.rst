Communication guidelines
=========================

Communication is one of the most important tool in any contributor's toolbox.
The Free & Open Source Software communities grew over the years, and now we have
various mediums to communicate over Internet. People are spread across the world
in different time zones, the cultures and primary languages are different among
us.


Be nice to everyone
---------------------

The most important point to start this guide, always be nice to everyone over
Internet. Do not use any improper words, or attack people. Everyone has their
own view point, and own opinion. That may not be the same of yours, but that
should not be the reason to start a heated argument over chat/meeting/mailing
list. People are opinionated, to solve some complex problem people will try to
force their ideas to everyone. But, the language should always remain civil. 


Do not assume pronouns of people
---------------------------------

Do not try to assume which pronoun to use while talking to someone. It is much
nicer if you use gender neutral words (or the names) in any type of
communication. `This guide <https://uwm.edu/lgbtrc/support/gender-pronouns/>`_
has more details which one should read.

------------------------------------------

* Direct emails
